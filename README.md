# Virtual_System_Controls
"Virtual System Controls" is a computer vision–based gesture control system that allows users to interact with their computer using only hand gestures captured through a webcam. At its core, the project relies on several key Python libraries to function seamlessly. OpenCV is used for capturing and processing live video frames from the webcam, flipping them for a mirror-like view, and drawing visual feedback such as hand landmarks and gesture labels directly on the video stream. The MediaPipe library by Google provides robust and efficient hand tracking, detecting up to 21 key landmarks on a user’s hand in real-time. These landmarks are then analyzed to extract gestures by computing the angles and distances between specific points—logic implemented using NumPy for efficient mathematical computations. A helper module (util.py) contains reusable functions like get_angle() for measuring finger bending and get_distance() for determining proximity between finger tips. Based on these analyses, gestures are mapped to system-level actions using PyAutoGUI—a library that simulates mouse movements and clicks by moving the cursor to specified screen coordinates and triggering mouse actions programmatically. For more precise mouse control, especially for pressing and releasing buttons, the project also employs the pynput library. Additionally, the random module is used to generate unique filenames for screenshots captured via gesture commands. The system detects gestures such as moving the cursor by pointing the index finger, clicking through specific finger bends (e.g., index for left click, middle for right click), double-clicking by bending both fingers, and capturing screenshots by making a closed-finger gesture. All interactions are accompanied by visual cues on the video frame, making the experience intuitive and user-friendly. Overall, the project is a creative blend of computer vision and automation tools that demonstrates how natural hand movements can be translated into meaningful digital commands.
